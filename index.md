## About Me
I am Jiahang Tu, a second-year Ph.D. student in the College of Computer Science at Zhejiang University, advised by Prof. [Hui Qian](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=n4csXw0AAAAJ). Prior to that, I received my B.Eng. degree from the Chien-Shiung Wu College at Southeast University. My research centers on generative models and embodied intelligence. In my earlier work, I focused on the safety and controllability of generative models, particularly diffusion-based methods for preventing the generation of unsafe or restricted content while preserving generative performance. More recently, my research has shifted toward robotic embodied intelligence, where I study unified multimodal models that integrate perception and generation for robotic understanding and interaction, with a particular emphasis on tactile sensing and cross-sensor generalization.
