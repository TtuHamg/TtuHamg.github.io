## About Me

I am Jiahang Tu, a first-year Ph.D. student in the College of Computer Science at Zhejiang University, advised by Prof. [Hui Qian](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=n4csXw0AAAAJ). Prior to that, I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree from the Chien-Shiung Wu College at Southeast University. My research interests lie in generative models, with a particular focus on their applications in downstream tasks such as data generation for autonomous driving and robotic tactile perception. Recently, I have been working on ensuring the safe use of diffusion models, aiming to prevent the generation of unsafe content.
